Documentation of changes which may break some install environments

1.9-dev
 - DC/OS binaries / config is no longer injected to user environment via /etc/profile.d/dcos.sh. New installs have just a single binary, `dcos-shell` added to $PATH. Can be used as `dcos-shell <cmd>` to run a single command or `dcos-shell` to start a new shell which has the environment variables sourced in which arbitrary commands can be run.

1.8
 - Marathon will refuse to accept new apps, and will refuse changes to existing
   apps which have the same servicePort as another app. servicePorts should be
   unique per app, but previously this wasn't enforced.
 - Most software doesn't run as root. Lots of paths that things use for storage
   or intermediate state changed as a result.
 - Zookeeper, exhibitor storage paths changed. Prior to upgrade, exhibitor
   config must be edited to point to new storage locations
 - Zookeeper should now log to journald
 - dcos-history-serivce was renamed to dcos-history
 - dcos-ddt.service was renamed to dcos-3dt.service
 - Updated to CoreOS Stable 1068.9.0
 - Make the admin load balancer in all templates do TCP, not HTTP load balancing
 - Switch Ubuntu in Azure to 16.04 LTS final release
 - Teach spartan / DNS to only listen on a local internal address
 - Make the installer preflight actually faile if SELinux is enabled
