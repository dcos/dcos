# DC/OS Testing

The dcos-integration-test harness and cloud deployment utilities that were previously hosted in this directory have been moved to: [DC/OS Test Utils](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-test-utils)

Currently, this directory contains:
* `run-all`: Checks out [DC/OS Vagrant](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant) and provides a DC/OS cluster from the onprem installer (`dcos_generate_config.sh`) sitting in the root of this repo (presumably generated by building DC/OS)
