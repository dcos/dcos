==================

**Autogenerated (2018-03-02) - Please do not edit this file**

Features 
--------

* `DCOS-21486 <https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS-21486>`_ Dont bind dcos-dns on k8s cluster dns ip address. This prevents k8s from crashing with eaddrinuse in error.

Bugfixes
--------

* `DCOS-21451 <https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS-21451>`_ Prevent reusing tcp sockets by AR's cache code. Fixes the bug when Marathon UI
  does not load due to failure in cache refresh.

* `DCOS_OSS-2210 <https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS_OSS-2210>`_ Ensure that cache timestamps are well-formed in dcos-history service.

  When the history service writes data to file, it adds a timestamp. At exactly zero microseconds past the second, this timestamp was malformed, and as a  result the history service could not load it.
