# Github Pull Request (PR) Labels

Various labels used on pull requests and what they mean

 - `Work In Progress` The code is a work in progress / not yet ready to be reviewed or acted upon by others. It can be handy to open up a PR in order to share work / ideas with others. Use this label to indicate the PR isn't intended to be reviewed or merged.
 - `Request For Comment` The code is some idea which may or may not land, but there are questions if the approach is right. Review should focus on whether or not it is overall a good idea to do this and how to structure it.
 - `Ready For Review` The author thinks the PR is ready to land, and is looking for a review in order to get it in. The PR may bounce back to "work in progress" or "request for comment" if it needs more work or discussion. Might also just do all the review and fixup with the label attached.
