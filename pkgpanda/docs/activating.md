# Activating Packages

`pkgpanda activate <id>... [options]` will activate the list of package ids in the command line.

The list of currently active packages is stored in `active.json` inside of `INSTALL_ROOT`. The `active.json` is swapped
out when old packages are disabled and new ones are enabled.

*TODO(cmaloney): Define the requirements for a system image / how things are loaded.*

Ex:

```
mesos-slave.service must
EnvironmentFile=--/opt/mesosphere/environment
EnvironmentFile=/opt/mesosphere/config/mesos-slave-config
```

## Activating new packages

1. Validate new list of packages to activate has no conflicts
    - No conflicting provides
    - No conflicting `systemd` names
    - No conflicting executable names
    - No conflicting environment variables
    - No conflicting `sysctl` settings
2. Archive old packages
    - `mv active.json active.json.old`
    - `rm -rf INSTALL_ROOT/bin INSTALL_ROOT/systemd INSTALL_ROOT/environment INSTALL_ROOT/config`
3. Write new active manifest to `active.json.new`
4. Install new package config
    - Symlink binaries for every package into `INSTALL_ROOT/bin`
    - Symlink config for each package into `INSTALL_ROOT/config/{provides}/`
    - Aggregate environment variables to `INSTALL_ROOT/environment`
5. Enable everything in `systemd`

Note: Starting/stopping services is the job of the restart helper or rebooting the machine.

First `active.json` is moved to `active.json.old`, then all of the old packages have their symlinks removed
in `INSTALL_ROOT/bin`, `INSTALL_ROOT/systemd`, `INSTALL_ROOT/environment` and `INSTALL_ROOT/config`.


## Sample active.json

```
[
  "mesos--0.22.0",
  "mesos-config-1",
  "mesos-systemd-12"
]
```
