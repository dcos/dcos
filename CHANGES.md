## DC/OS 2.1.0-beta2 (in development)


### What's new

* Upgrade coreOS AMIs (D2IQ-64271)
* Added a new configuration option `mesos_http_executors_domain_sockets`, which will cause the mesos-agent to use
  domain sockets when communicating with executors. While this change should not have any visible impact on users
  in itself, it does enable administrators to write firewall rules blocking unauthorized access to the agent port
  5051 since access to this will not be required anymore for executors to work.

* Switched from Oracle Java 8 to OpenJDK 8 (DCOS-54902)

* Updated DC/OS UI to [v3.0.7](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-ui/releases/tag/v3.0.7).

* The configuration option `MARATHON_ACCEPTED_RESOURCE_ROLES_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR` replaces the config option `MARATHON_DEFAULT_ACCEPTED_RESOURCE_ROLES`. Please see the Marathon [command-line flag documentation](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/docs/docs/command-line-flags.md) for a description of the flag.

* Updated to Mesos [1.10.0-dev](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/54227a33b68d83b97ef1a7c14283351d45322317/CHANGELOG)

### Breaking changes

* Remove the octarine package from DC/OS. It was originally used as a proxy for the CLI but is not used for this purpose, anymore.

* DC/OS Net: wait till agents become active before fanning out Mesos tasks. (DCOS_OSS-5463)

* Remove the avro-cpp package from DC/OS. It was originally used as part of the metrics-collection framework which now relies on a different infrastructure.

* Remove the spartan package from DC/OS. Is was deprecated in 1.11 and replaced by dcos-net.

* Remove the toybox package from DC/OS. Is was used only by Spartan.

* Remove the dcos-history-service from DC/OS. (DCOS-58529)

* New format for Admin Router access logs. (DCOS-59598)

* Update OpenResty to 1.15.8.2. (DCOS-61159)

### Fixed and improved

* Reserve all agent VTEP IPs upon recovering from replicated log. (DCOS_OSS-5626)

* Set network interfaces as unmanaged for networkd only on coreos. (DCOS-60956)
* Allow Admin Router to accept files up to 32GB, such as for uploading large packages to Package Registry. (DCOS-61233)

* Marathon launched too many tasks. (DCOS-62078)

* Marathon used to omit pod status report with tasks in `TASK_UNKONW` state. (MARATHON-8710)

* Update Kazoo to version 2.6.1. (DCOS-63065)

* With UnreachableStrategy, setting `expungeAfterSeconds` and `inactiveAfterSeconds` to the same value will cause the
  instance to be expunged immediately; this helps with `GROUP_BY` or `UNIQUE` constraints. (MARATHON-8719)

* Updated dcos-config.yaml to support some Mesos Flags. (DCOS-59021)

* Fix Telegraf migration when no containers present. (D2IQ-64507)
