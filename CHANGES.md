## DC/OS 1.13.9 (In developement)

### Notable changes

### Fixed and improved

### Security updates


## DC/OS 1.13.8 (2020-02-27)

### Notable changes

* Updated to Mesos [1.8.2-dev](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/bb32bf8732af3e941aa651c82f5c4f3f03e2e139/CHANGELOG)

### Fixed and improved

* Marathon: Pod status reports would miss tasks in state `TASK_UNKOWN` (MARATHON-8710)

* Fixed preflight check verifying the `ftype` value of /var/lib/mesos. (DCOS-59406)

* Allow Admin Router to accept files up to 32GB, such as for uploading large packages to Package Registry. (DCOS-61233)

* DC/OS no longer increases the rate limit for journald logging.  Scale testing demonstrated that raising the limit overloads journald, causing problems for other components that see delayed or lost logs or, worse, hang until log buffers are read. The default of 10000 messages per 30 seconds appears to distinguish well between busy components and excessively verbose components. (DCOS-53763)

* Fix Telegraf migration when no containers present. (D2IQ-64507)

* Marathon version bumped to 1.8.239

    * /v2/tasks plaintext output in Marathon 1.5 returned container network endpoints in an unusable way (MARATHON-8721)
    * Unreachable instances would interfere with replacements when using GROUP_BY / UNIQUE placement constraints, even if expungeAfter is configured the same as inactiveAfter (MARATHON-8719)

* Adjust dcos-net (l4lb) to allow for graceful shutdown of connections by changing the VIP backend weight to `0`
  when tasks are unhealthy or enter the `TASK_KILLING` state instead of removing them. (D2IQ-61077)

## DC/OS 1.13.0 (2019-05-13)

### Highlights

#### Introduction of service accounts, alignment of authentication architectures

The core of the DC/OS Enterprise identity and access management service (IAM) has been open-sourced and added to DC/OS, replacing `dcos-oauth`. CockroachDB was added as a DC/OS component as a highly available database serving the IAM.

With that DC/OS now supports service accounts. Service accounts allow individual tools and applications to interact with a DC/OS cluster using their own identity. A successful service account login results in authentication proof -- the DC/OS authentication token. A valid DC/OS authentication token is required in order to access DC/OS services and components through Master Admin Router.

This change also aligned the authentication architectures between DC/OS Enterprise and DC/OS: the HTTP API for service account management as well as for service account login is now the same in both systems. The DC/OS authentication token implementation details are equivalent in both systems: it is a JSON Web Token (JWT) of type RS256 which can be validated by any component in the system after consulting the IAM's JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint.

#### DC/OS monitoring overhaul

Most DC/OS components (Admin Router, CockroachDB, ZooKeeper, Exhibitor, Root Marathon, Metronome, Spartan, Lashup, and others) now emit more useful metrics into the DC/OS metrics pipeline than before.

The new `DC/OS monitoring service` can be deployed from the DC/OS Universe. It consumes the metrics emitted by DC/OS components and workloads, feeds them into a time series database and provides a curated set of Grafana dashboards for a holistic DC/OS monitoring approach.

### Known limitations

* Authentication tokens emitted by `dcos-oauth` prior to an upgrade from DC/OS version 1.12.x to DC/OS version 1.13.x will become invalid during the upgrade. Simply log in again.

### Breaking changes

No breaking changes are known to date.

### What's new

* Introduced the `dcos-ui-update-service`. This component exposes an API which allows for updating the `dcos-ui` from the DC/OS Universe. In this release, the default DC/OS UI was updated to version [master+v2.40.10](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-ui/releases/tag/master%2Bv2.40.10).

* Marathon 1.8 is now included. Among others, it adds the ability to launch app or pod containers defined with a seccomp profile.

* Introduced the DC/OS configuration options `metronome_gpu_scheduling_behavior` and `marathon_gpu_scheduling_behavior`. By default, their values are set to `restricted`.

* Metronome now supports the universal containerizer (UCR), as well as the "file-based secrets", and "hybrid cloud" DC/OS capabilities.

* Environment variables can now be set for `docker-gc` in `/var/lib/dcos/docker-gc.env`. (DCOS_OSS-1140)

* Master Admin Router: the service endpoint at `/service/<service-name>` does not strip the `Accept-Encoding` header anymore from requests, allowing services to serve compressed responses to user agents. (DCOS_OSS-4906)

* Admin Router now returns relative redirects to avoid relying on the Host header. (DCOS-47845)

* Admin Router now collects so-called virtual host metrics, for fine-grained monitoring. Each Admin Router instance exposes a summary at `/nginx/status`. (DCOS_OSS-4562)

* Admin Router now logs to a non-blocking Unix domain socket. If `journald` fails to read the socket quickly enough, log messages may be lost. Before, Admin Router hang in this case (stopping to process requests). (DCOS-43956)

* Master Admin Router now exposes the DC/OS Net API via `/net`. This can be used, for example, for reading the public IP addresses of public agent nodes (`/net/v1/nodes`). (DCOS_OSS-1837)

* DC/OS Net: ipv6 support is now enabled in L4LB by default. (DCOS_OSS-1993)

* DC/OS Net: OTP has been upgraded to version 21.3. (DCOS_OSS-4902)

* Mesos metrics are now available by default. (DCOS_OSS-3815)

* Metrics are tagged with their fault domain region and zone. (DCOS-16570)

* Internal metrics for the Telegraf-based metrics pipeline are now exposed. (DCOS_OSS-4608)

* Telegraf's statsd input plugin reports additional internal metrics. (DCOS_OSS-4759)

* Telegraf's procstat input plugin reports process metrics. (DCOS-50778)

* Telegraf has been upgraded to 1.9.4. (DCOS_OSS-4675)

* Allow the DC/OS installer to be used when there is a space in its path. (DCOS_OSS-4429)

* Added a warning to the installer to let the user know in case kernel modules required by the DC/OS storage service are not loaded. (DCOS-49088)

* Set network interfaces as unmanaged for networkd only on coreos. (DCOS-60956)
