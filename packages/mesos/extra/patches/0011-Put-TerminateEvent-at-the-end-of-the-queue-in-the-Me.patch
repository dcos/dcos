Subject: [PATCH 11/13] Put `TerminateEvent` at the end of the queue in the
 Mesos library.

This is to ensure all pending dispatches are processed. However
multistage events, e.g., `Call`, might still be dropped, because
a continuation (stage) of such event can be dispatched after the
termination event.
