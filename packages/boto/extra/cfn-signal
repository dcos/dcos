Send SUCCESS signal to the CloudFormation stack as specified by the

    AWS_STACK_ID

environment variable. The name of the resource that is signaled (within the
stack) is specified by the environment variable

    AWS_CFN_SIGNAL_THIS_RESOURCE.

According to the docs, this must correspond to "the name of the resource that
given in the template." (sic)

Obtain and use AWS IAM Temporary Security Credentials from

    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<role>

whereas <role> is specified by either

    AWS_IAM_MASTER_ROLE_NAME
    or
    AWS_IAM_SLAVE_ROLE_NAME

depending on whether this instance is a slave or master. It is considered
master only if a file named 'master' is contained in /etc/mesosphere/roles.

(Note: boto3 would query the security-credentials service automatically if
it does not find credentials in the environment or in one of its config files.
In this case here, explicit is better than implicit.)

The SignalResource API requires a unique signal ID parameter. Although not
clearly documented, in this case it seems to be *required* that the signal ID
corresponds to the instance ID of the current EC2 instance. The most explicit
way to retrieve the current instance ID is via
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id (injection via CFN
template is not easily done in case of instances defined by an
AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile resource, as is the case here).
