        This data is often manipulated by methods nested across

        The need for the lock itself stems from the fact that very often certain
        keys of the context need to be manipulated at the same time/in synchronized
        manner.

        In some of the places, code relies on thread safety/atomicity of
        some of Python's expressions/statements:

            https://docs.python.org/3.6/faq/library.html#what-kinds-of-global-value-mutation-are-thread-safe

       The state of the endpoint may be changed by tests/fixtures by executing
       Mocker's .send_command() method which in turn redirect the call to the
