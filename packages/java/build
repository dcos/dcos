# The following command was added when moving from Oracle Java 8 to OpenJDK 8.
# The cacerts from the downloaded OpenJDK were causing Gradle download failures when building the exhibitor package,
# so they are replaced with the system cacerts (Ubuntu 16.04).
# The OpenJDK 8 tarball hosted at https://downloads.mesosphere.io/java/openjdk-8u40-b25-linux-x64-10_feb_2015.tar.gz
# was originally downloaded from https://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk8u40/ri/openjdk-8u40-b25-linux-x64-10_feb_2015.tar.gz
