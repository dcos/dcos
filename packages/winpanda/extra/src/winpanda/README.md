# Winpanda 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Winpanda is a part of DC/OS Windows Agent node management toolset. It manages
the whole lifecycle of a DC/OS service package at a Windows Agent node,
beginning from initial package installation (download, install, configure) to
host OS service management (setup, start, stop, remove, etc.) and to
upgrade/downgrade package version.  
  Winpanda should not be confused with the Pkgpanda tool, which provides much
wider range of functionality. It only implements for DC/OS Windows agent nodes
a part of functionality of the Pkgpanda, which is involved in package
management on DC/OS Linux agent nodes.
