    In a cluster with an Exhibitor backend consisting of a static ZooKeeper
    ensemble, after removing one master, and then adding another master with
    the same IP address, the cluster will get to a healthy state. This is
    repeated until all masters in the original cluster have been replaced.
    The purpose of this test is to assert that the ``node-poststart``
    procedure correctly prevents a master node replacement from being performed
    too quickly. A new master node should only become part of the cluster if
    there are no more underreplicated ranges reported by CockroachDB.

    Permanent CockroachDB data loss and a potential breakage of DC/OS occurs
    when a second master node is taken down for replacement while CockroachDB
    is recovering and there are still underreplicated ranges due to a recent
    other master node replacement.
