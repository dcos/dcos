# Purpose of this file
# ====================
#
# We split E2E tests into groups so that the test suite can be run in
# parallel on CI.
# We could split these tests arbitrarily using, for example,
# https://pypi.org/project/pytest-test-groups/.
# However, a downside of this is that tests may move between groups as the test
# suite size changes.
# When a test moves between groups, we lose data from TeamCity, such as
# statistics on test success rate.
#
# Details of this file
# ====================
#
# The number of groups matches the number of TeamCity jobs for this test suite.
# That is, if there are three groups, there must be three CI jobs, one for each
# group.
#
# Each item in a group is a pytest pattern.
# That means, when collected by pytest in the E2E tests directory, this
# must collect some tests.
# For example, the following might be valid patterns:
# * test_filename.py
# * test_filename.py::TestClassName
# * test_filename.py::TestClassName::test_function_name
#
# Changing test groupings
# =======================
#
# A goal is to have roughly even run time on each test group.
# The test suite's run length is the length of time it takes to run the longest
# group.
#
# In conflict with this goal is the cost of moving tests around.
# Any developer moving a test from one group to the other, to decreate the test
# suite's run length, must consider this trade-off.
#
# ``test_meta.py`` includes a test which asserts that the groups defined here
# account for each test.
#
# Changing the number of groups
# =============================
#
# The number of groups here must be reflected in TeamCity.
# That is, there must be a builder which runs each group.
#
# If a group is added or renamed and no change is made to TeamCity, tests in
# that group will not be run on CI.
#
# If a group is removed and no change is made to TeamCity, a CI builder will
# fail.
