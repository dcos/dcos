USAGE: $(basename "$0") <device> <mount_location>

 This script will format, and persistently mount the device to the specified
 location. It is intended to run as an early systemd unit (local-fs-pre.target)
 on AWS to set up EBS volumes.

 If <mount_location> is /var/log the script will migrate existing data to the
 new filesystem.

 It will only execute if <device> doesn't already contain a filesystem.

EXAMPLES:

 $(basename "$0") /dev/xvde /dcos/volume1
